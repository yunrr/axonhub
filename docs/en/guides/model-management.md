# Model Management Guide

This guide explains how to manage AI models in AxonHub and use "Model Associations" for intelligent routing.

## Core Concepts: Models and Channels

### Simple Analogy

Imagine you're sending a package:
- **Model** = The type of item you want to send (e.g., "document", "package")
- **Channel** = Different courier companies (e.g., "SF Express", "YTO")
- **Model Association** = Your rule: "Documents go via SF Express, packages via YTO; if SF fails, use YTO"

In AxonHub:
- **Model**: An abstract name you expose, like `gpt-4` or `claude-sonnet`
- **Channel**: An actual AI provider connection
- **Model Association**: Determines which channel and actual model to use when a client requests a model
- **Developer Rule**: A reusable channel rule configured once for a model developer and inherited by models from the same developer

### Request Flow

```
Client Request: "Please answer using gpt-4"
        ↓
System Lookup: What associations does gpt-4 have?
        ↓
Association Resolution: Priority 0 → OpenAI channel's gpt-4-turbo
                       Priority 1 → DeepSeek channel's deepseek-chat
        ↓
Load Balancing: Select best channel to execute request
```

## Where Model Association Fits in the Request Flow

Model Association is the **middle** step in a three-layer pipeline. For the full picture, see [Request Processing Guide](../getting-started/request-processing.md#core-concept-three-layers-of-model-settings).

In short: **API Key Profile renames → Model Association selects channel → Channel renames → Send upstream**

## Developer Rule Inheritance

If multiple models from the same developer should use the same channel rules, configure **Developer Rules** on the developer group in the model list. A developer rule only selects a channel or channel tags. It does not lock in a specific upstream model; at routing time, each concrete model uses its own model ID when searching those channels.

By default, a model inherits developer rules from the same developer and merges them with rules configured directly on the model:

- Smaller `priority` values run first.
- When priorities tie, model-level rules take precedence over inherited developer rules.
- Enable **Do not inherit developer settings** in a model's association dialog when that model should use only its own rules.

## Model Association Types

Model associations are "routing rules." AxonHub supports 6 rule types:

### 1. Specific Channel, Specific Model (Most Precise)

**Purpose**: Precise control over which model version goes through which channel

**Configuration in Admin UI:**
- Association Type: "Specific Channel Model"
- Priority: 0
- Channel: OpenAI (ID: 1)
- Model: gpt-4-turbo

**Scenario**: "When user wants gpt-4, prioritize using OpenAI channel's gpt-4-turbo"

### 2. Specific Channel, Regex Match (More Flexible)

**Purpose**: Match a batch of models in a specific channel

**Configuration in Admin UI:**
- Association Type: "Channel Regex Match"
- Priority: 1
- Channel: DeepSeek (ID: 2)
- Pattern: `gpt-4.*`

**Scenario**: "All models starting with gpt-4 in the DeepSeek channel are acceptable"

**Common Patterns:**
- `gpt-4.*` — Matches `gpt-4`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4-vision`
- `claude-3-.*-sonnet` — Matches `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `claude-3-opus-sonnet`
- `.*` — Matches all models

### 3. All Channels, Regex Match (Most Flexible)

**Purpose**: Find matching models across all enabled channels

**Configuration in Admin UI:**
- Association Type: "Global Regex Match"
- Priority: 2
- Pattern: `gpt-4.*`
- Exclude Channels with Tags: `test`

**Scenario**: "Any gpt-4 series model from any channel, but exclude test channels"

### 4. All Channels, Specific Model

**Purpose**: Don't specify channel; any channel supporting this model can be used

**Configuration in Admin UI:**
- Association Type: "Global Model Match"
- Priority: 3
- Model: gpt-4

**Scenario**: "Any channel supporting gpt-4 can be a backup"

### 5. Tagged Channels, Specific Model

**Purpose**: Select based on channel tags (e.g., only production environment channels)

**Configuration in Admin UI:**
- Association Type: "Tagged Channel Model"
- Priority: 4
- Channel Tags: production, high-performance
- Model: gpt-4

**Scenario**: "Only look for gpt-4 in channels tagged as production or high-performance"

### 6. Tagged Channels, Regex Match

**Purpose**: Tag + regex combination

**Configuration in Admin UI:**
- Association Type: "Tagged Channel Regex"
- Priority: 5
- Channel Tags: openai, azure
- Pattern: `gpt-4.*`

**Scenario**: "Find gpt-4 series models in OpenAI or Azure channels"

## Priority Settings

**Smaller priority value = Higher priority**

Recommended settings:
- **Primary channels**: Priority 0-10
- **Backup channels**: Priority 10-50
- **Emergency channels**: Priority 50-100

Example configuration in Admin UI:
- Association 1: Priority 0 (Highest priority: Primary)
  - Type: Specific Channel Model
  - Channel: OpenAI
  - Model: gpt-4o
- Association 2: Priority 10 (Lower priority: Backup)
  - Type: Global Model Match
  - Model: gpt-4

## System Settings

In **System Settings > Model Settings**, there are three common options:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Query All Channel Models | Enabled | When enabled, `/v1/models` API returns all models from enabled channels + configured models |
| Fallback to Channels on Model Not Found | Enabled | When enabled, if requested model has no associations, system automatically finds channels supporting it |
| Hide Unroutable Models in Lists | Disabled | When enabled, public model-list APIs hide configured models that the current API key cannot structurally route to a capable channel. Requests for those models still return 422. The admin models table is unchanged. |

**Recommendations:**
- For beginners: Keep Query All Channel Models and Fallback to Channels enabled; leave Hide Unroutable Models off unless list/call mismatches matter
- For strict control: Disable Query All Channel Models and Fallback to Channels so only explicitly configured models are used; enable Hide Unroutable Models so `/v1/models` matches that routing

## FAQ

### Q: Why does the request say "Model not found"?

Check in order:
1. Is the model created?
2. Are model associations configured with correct channels?
3. Are channels enabled?
4. Do channels support the models specified in associations?
5. If the model should inherit developer rules, is **Do not inherit developer settings** disabled?

### Q: How to verify associations are working?

1. Send a test request
2. Check the Trace in the console to see which channel the request actually went through
3. Check logs for candidate selection records

### Q: Will too many associations affect performance?

Generally no significant impact, but recommended:
- No more than 10 association rules per model
- Avoid overly complex regex patterns

### Q: Will the same (channel, model) combination be duplicated?

No, the system automatically deduplicates.

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**: Use standardized model names like `gpt-4`, `claude-3-opus`
2. **Priority Planning**: Primary 0-10, backup 10-50, emergency 50-100
3. **Use Tags**: Tag channels (e.g., production, test) for batch management
4. **Test Before Enabling**: Verify request routing in the console after configuration
5. **Regular Review**: Clean up unused models and association rules

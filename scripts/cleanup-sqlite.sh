# AxonHub SQLite Database Cleanup Script
# Issue: https://github.com/looplj/axonhub/issues/1905

# Usage:
#   ./scripts/cleanup-sqlite.sh [DB_PATH] [RETENTION_DAYS]
#
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/cleanup-sqlite.sh                          # uses default path, 30 days
#   ./scripts/cleanup-sqlite.sh ./axonhub.db 7           # custom path, keep 7 days
#   ./scripts/cleanup-sqlite.sh ./axonhub.db 0           # delete ALL historical data

# value, so comparing an integer column against datetime('now', '-90 days') is true for
# *every* row and the statement deletes the whole table - in production that wiped
# channels, api_keys, projects and users in a single run.
# Both branches below are guarded on the stored value type, so a numeric value can never
# be compared as text (nor the reverse) and the '' / '0'/ NULL sentinels never match.

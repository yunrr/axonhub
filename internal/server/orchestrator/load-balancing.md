# Channel Load Balancing

This document describes the load balancing system for channel selection in AxonHub.

## Overview

After channels are selected based on model compatibility, they are sorted using a load balancing system that considers multiple factors to determine the optimal order for attempting requests.

### Animated Demonstration

The load balancing flow now has an accompanying SVG animation (`load-balancing.svg`) that visualizes how requests move between AxonHub and backend channels while their **Score** and progress bars fluctuate in real time. Open the file directly or embed it in documentation sites to see:

- Channel A degrading and recovering, with its score oscillating between 95 → 80 → 45 → 60 while the bar shrinks and regrows
- Channel B absorbing extra load when Channel A degrades, showing 65 → 33 → 65 score transitions
- Channel C remaining in error cooldown with a pulsing score between 20 → 18 → 10 → 12 → 15

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **LoadBalanceStrategy Interface** - Defines how strategies score channels
2. **LoadBalancer** - Orchestrates multiple strategies to sort channels
3. **Strategy Implementations** - Concrete implementations for different prioritization criteria

### Strategy Pattern

The load balancing system uses the Strategy pattern to make the prioritization logic extensible and composable. Each strategy independently scores channels, and the LoadBalancer combines these scores to produce a final ordering.

## Built-in Strategies

### Trace Sticky Candidate Selection

**Purpose**: Sticky routing for conversational consistency before normal load-balancer scoring.

**Algorithm**:
1. Reads the current trace ID, then the thread ID, from the request context.
2. Reads the previous successful channel ID from the routing cache (trace first, thread as fallback).
3. If that channel is still an eligible candidate, places it first and load-balances the remaining fallback candidates.
4. A cache miss or expiry falls back directly to normal load balancing; it never queries historical requests.

**Pros**:
- Keeps multi-turn conversations on the channel that already succeeded while the cache entry is valid.
- Does not distort load-balancer scores.

**Cons**:
- Requires trace or thread propagation; no benefit if upstream systems omit both.
- Affinity is intentionally lost after the routing-cache TTL expires or the cache is unavailable.

### 1. ErrorAwareStrategy (Priority: 0-200 points)

**Purpose**: Deprioritizes channels based on their recent error history.

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Consecutive Failures**: -30 points per consecutive failure (decayed linearly over the cooldown period)
- **Recent Failure**: A base penalty of -40 (decayed linearly over the cooldown period)
- **Base Score**: 200 points (for healthy channels)

**Use Case**: Avoids channels experiencing issues and promotes reliable channels by penalizing failures without permanent stigmatization.

**Implementation**:
```go
NewErrorAwareStrategy(channelService)
```

### 2. WeightStrategy (Priority: 0-100 points)

**Purpose**: Respects admin-configured channel priorities.

**Algorithm**:
1. Reads the `OrderingWeight` (typically 0-100) from the channel configuration.
2. Normalizes the weight to the `maxScore` (default 100) range.
3. If weight is negative, it is clamped to 0.

**Pros**:
- Direct control over channel priority for administrators.
- Simple and predictable.

**Cons**:
- Static; does not react to live performance or load unless weights are manually updated.

### 3. WeightRoundRobinStrategy (Priority: 0-150 points)

**Purpose**: Blends historic request distribution with admin-defined weights.

**Algorithm**:
1. Fetches `AggregatedMetrics` for each channel.
2. Normalizes the sliding-window request count by `OrderingWeight` (non-positive values use the default effective weight of 100 to preserve the scoring scale relative to health and latency signals).
3. Computes `150 / (1 + normalizedCount / 150)`, which stays strictly decreasing without a count cap or score floor.
4. Lets the shared sliding window expire old load; the strategy does not apply a second inactivity decay.

**Pros**:
- Prevents hot channels from monopolizing requests while still honoring business priorities.
- New or underused channels receive a higher score immediately.

**Cons**:
- Requires metrics storage similar to ErrorAwareStrategy.
- Heavily skewed manual weights can still override fairness, so administrators must tune carefully.

### 4. Connection Tracking and Concurrency Fallback

**Purpose**: Track in-flight requests and provide concurrency saturation signals for `RateLimitAwareStrategy`.

**Algorithm**:
1. The orchestrator increments and decrements active connections around each upstream request.
2. `RateLimitAwareStrategy` first respects explicit `MaxConcurrent` configuration.
3. If `MaxConcurrent` is not set, it falls back to the default `ConnectionTracker` capacity to penalize or exhaust saturated channels.

**Notes**:
- Connection tracking remains part of the runtime path even though `ConnectionAwareStrategy` is no longer in the default strategy chain.
- This makes concurrency protection part of rate-limit scoring instead of a standalone production strategy.

## Default Configuration

The `DefaultChannelSelector` uses these strategies in order:

```go
loadBalancer := NewLoadBalancer(
    NewErrorAwareStrategy(channelService),                          // Health
    NewWeightRoundRobinStrategy(channelService),                    // Fairness + admin weight
    NewLatencyAwareStrategy(channelService),                        // Streaming FTTL/TPS or non-streaming latency
    NewRateLimitAwareStrategy(rateLimitTracker, connectionTracker), // Rate limits + concurrency fallback
)
```

The selector wraps this load balancer with `WithTraceStickyLoadBalancedSelector`, which performs trace/thread affinity before score-based sorting.

### Default Strategy Mix Analysis

**Strengths**:
1. **Stability first** – Trace sticky selection places the cached channel first when it remains eligible.
2. **Fair utilization** – WeightRoundRobin keeps new or idle channels active without ignoring business priorities.
3. **Real-time protection** – LatencyAware and RateLimitAware react to live first-token latency, throughput, end-to-end latency, concurrency, and cooldown state before a channel is fully overloaded.

**Trade-offs**:
1. Requires multiple runtime signals (trace/thread, cache, metrics, connections); missing data downgrades overall accuracy.
2. Cache expiry resets affinity, so the normal strategies must provide sensible fallback routing.
3. Concurrency protection depends on accurate connection tracking and sensible `MaxConcurrent` or tracker capacities.

## Observability

### Structured Decision Logging

The load balancer provides comprehensive structured logging for debugging and monitoring:

**Decision Summary Log**:
```json
{
  "level": "debug",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-22T10:30:15Z",
  "msg": "Load balancing decision completed",
  "channel_count": 3,
  "duration_ms": 12.5,
  "top_channel_id": 1,
  "top_channel_name": "openai-us",
  "top_channel_score": 280.0,
  "model": "gpt-4"
}
```

**Channel Details Log** (one per channel):
```json
{
  "level": "debug",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-22T10:30:15Z",
  "msg": "Channel load balancing details",
  "channel_id": 1,
  "channel_name": "openai-us",
  "total_score": 280.0,
  "final_rank": 1,
  "strategy_breakdown": {
    "ErrorAware": {
      "score": 200.0,
      "duration_ms": 5.3
    },
    "Weight": {
      "score": 80.0,
      "duration_ms": 0.1
    }
  },
  "model": "gpt-4"
}
```

**Strategy-Level Logging**:
- Trace sticky selection is visible from the selected candidate order rather than a strategy score.
- ErrorAwareStrategy: Logs all penalties (consecutive failures, recent failures) and calculation details
- **WeightStrategy**: Logs weight calculation with clamping warnings

### Debug Mode

Debug mode provides enhanced observability for troubleshooting:

**Enable via Context**:
```go
opts := &chat.DebugOptions{
    Enabled:               true,
    RecordDecisionDetails: true,
    RecordStrategyDetails: true,
}
ctx = chat.EnableDebugMode(ctx, opts)
```

**DebugInfo Structure**:
```go
type DebugInfo struct {
    RequestID      string
    Timestamp      time.Time
    Model          string
    InputChannels  []ChannelDebugInfo   // Before sorting
    OutputChannels []ChannelDebugInfo   // After sorting
    TotalDuration  time.Duration
}
```

Each `ChannelDebugInfo` includes:
- Channel ID and name
- Total score
- Detailed scores from each strategy
- Strategy execution duration
- Final rank

**Retrieve Debug Info**:
```go
if info := chat.GetDebugInfo(ctx); info != nil {
    // Access detailed decision information
    for _, ch := range info.OutputChannels {
        log.Info(ctx, "Channel ranking",
            log.Int("channel_id", ch.ChannelID),
            log.Int("rank", ch.Rank),
            log.Float64("total_score", ch.TotalScore),
        )
    }
}
```

### Strategy-Specific Logs

**ErrorAwareStrategy** logs:
- Debug: All penalty calculations with values and reasons
  - Consecutive failures penalty
  - Recent failure penalty (with time-based decay)
  - Low success rate penalty (< 50%)
- Debug: All boost calculations
  - Recent success boost (within 1 minute)
  - High success rate boost (> 90%)
- Warn: When metrics unavailable (uses neutral score)
- Debug: When score clamped to 0

**WeightStrategy** logs:
- Warn: When channel has negative weight (clamped to 0)
- Trace: Weight calculation details

### Viewing Logs

**Enable Debug Logging**:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
# or for production
export LOG_LEVEL=info  # will see warnings and errors
```

**Filter Load Balancer Logs**:
```bash
# View all load balancer decisions
tail -f axonhub.log | grep "Load balancing decision"

# View specific channel details
tail -f axonhub.log | grep "Channel load balancing details"

# View ErrorAware strategy logs
tail -f axonhub.log | grep "ErrorAwareStrategy"

# Use jq for structured JSON logs
 tail -f axonhub.log | jq 'select(.msg | contains("Load balancing"))'
 ```

**Production Log Analysis**:
```bash
# Find channels with low scores due to errors
grep "ErrorAwareStrategy.*penalty" axonhub.log | \
  jq '{channel: .channel_name, penalty_reason: .details} | select(.penalty_reason != null)'

```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Logging Overhead**: Debug-level logs have minimal performance impact when disabled (default log level is typically info or higher)
2. **Structured Logging**: Uses efficient JSON encoding with zap logger
3. **Context-Aware**: Helper functions safely extract request information from context
4. **Opt-in Debug Mode**: Debug mode is disabled by default; explicit opt-in required
5. **Graceful Degradation**: If context information is missing, logs use sensible defaults (e.g., "unknown" for model)

### Debugging Strategy Behavior

**Verify trace sticky selection**:
```bash
# Send request with existing trace_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Trace-ID: 12345" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}]
  }'

# Send a second request with the same trace ID within the routing-cache TTL.
# Its selected candidate should be the previous successful channel when still eligible.
```

**Verify ErrorAwareStrategy**:
```bash
# Force channel errors by using invalid API key# Then check logs for penalty application
tail -f axonhub.log | grep "consecutive_failures_penalty"
tail -f axonhub.log | grep "recent_failure_penalty"

# Monitor recovery after fixing errors
tail -f axonhub.log | grep "recent_success_boost"
tail -f axonhub.log | grep "high_success_rate_boost"
```

**Verify WeightStrategy**:
```bash
# Set channel weights in admin UI or database
# Channel A: weight 100
# Channel B: weight 50

# Send multiple requests and check rankings
tail -f axonhub.log | grep "WeightStrategy" | jq '{channel: .channel_name, score: .score}'
# Should see Channel A with double the score of Channel B
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Connection Tracking**: Expose richer per-channel concurrency telemetry for observability and tuning
2. **A/B Testing**: Support for experimental channel routing
3. **Metrics Integration**: Prometheus metrics for load balancer decisions
4. **Decision Auditing**: Persistent storage of load balancing decisions for analysis
